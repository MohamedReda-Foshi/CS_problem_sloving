### pointers


### array
*s==s[0];

*s is a pointer to the first element of the array

what is array: array is a table of data could be characters or digit
is only contane one type of data if it characters we call is string if not we call is array of number
on that Examples.

Examples char s[]="reda" -> |r|e|d|a|'\0'|
Index,0,1,2,3,4
Value,'R','e','d','a','\0'

0->r
1->e
2->d
3->a
4->'\0'


what is '\0' or null character

is the we use it to tell the cpu that is end of string (array of char)

*s is pointer of array: so is pointing on array give as all array element

when we use s is mean only the first index of the array 


data type:

char | 1 byte
int  | 4 byte
float| 4 byte; 

as you see here char only 1 byte and '\0' take it;

so that why we could not use '\0' on array of number (int/float)


### command line arguments

int main() is a function and he take a parammeters
Examples:
./a.out reda1  reda2

reda1 and reda2 is parammeters

int main(int argc,char argv)
